The small Led Display, RGBARR, is a single LED panel of around 32 cm long, the equivalent of 64 pixels, but can be configured to as many as 10 panels per row or even more.

At the smallest dimensions, 32x16 cm (64x32 pixels), the display can show three characters written at their largest size. It is usually used in combination with Metrici Parking Place Detector to show number of free/busy places for every row in the parking lot, at the end of the line.
